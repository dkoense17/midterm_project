# Midterm Project Outline
By Drew Koense

1. The problem that I will be exploring is the climate change issue in the world today. More importantly, the renewable energy being created and the consumption of greenhouse gasses. Consumption of greenhouse gasses, like CO2, is one of the largest reasons for the worldwide climate change. The world has a natural change in temperature over time, but it has been suggested that humans are accelerating this change at a dangerous rate. 
2. Some of the questions that I will look to answer include:
- Which countries are the most responsible for CO2 emissions?
- Are countries doing enough to increase their renewable energy sources to replace the burning of greenhouse gasses?
- Is there a correlation with global temperature and greenhouse gas emissions?
- Is there a correlation with global temperature and renewable energy production?
3. These are very important issues in the world because climate change can have a massive effect on almost everything. The increase in temperature can have drastic effects on wildlife. It can also bring in more droughts, which could have massive effects on farming and therefore the food supply. The sea level will also rise because the ice caps in the poles will melt, rising sea levels could have devastating effects on the coastal cities of the world.

4.  Datasets:
- [CO2 emissions dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)
- [Renewable energy dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy)
- [Global temperature dataset](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/graph_data/Global_Mean_Estimates_based_on_Land_and_Ocean_Data/graph.txt)
5. Some ethical questions could include:
- Will the results show people are in danger because of the rapid changing effects?
- Will these potential dangers be more harmful to countries that are less developed?
- What variables cause some countries to be far more harmful to the environment than others? Are those variables changeable without drastically and negatively affecting the lives of the people in those countries?
- Can we slow down the rapid change without drastic affects on society as a whole?
- If yes to the previous question, is it financially possible?
